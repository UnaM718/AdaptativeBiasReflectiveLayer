# Adaptive Bias Reflective Layer

This project provides a PyTorch layer designed to reduce biases in AI models, developed with the assistance of Grok (xAI), ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Claude (Anthropic). It uses multi-scale projections and KL divergence to correct biases in model representations.

## Purpose
The goal of this layer is to make AI models fairer by dynamically adjusting their outputs. It is released as open source to allow experts to test and improve it.

## Context
- The code was generated and optimized by Grok, ChatGPT, and Claude.
- I am not a computer scientist and cannot answer technical questions. Please contribute via issues or pull requests.

## License
- This project is licensed under the MIT license (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE)file).

## Usage
```python
import torch
from bias_correction_layer import AdaptiveBiasReflectiveLayerV7

layer = AdaptiveBiasReflectiveLayerV7(hidden_dim=768) un
x = torch.randn(16, 24, 768)
output = layer(x)
