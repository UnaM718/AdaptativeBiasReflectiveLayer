# ABRL
# Adaptive Bias Reflective Layer

This project provides a PyTorch layer designed to reduce biases in AI models, developed with the assistance of Grok (xAI), ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Claude (Anthropic). It uses multi-scale projections and KL divergence to correct biases in model representations.

## Purpose
The goal of this layer is to make AI models fairer by dynamically adjusting their outputs. It is released as open source to allow experts to test and improve it.

## Potential Innovation 
This layer introduces a novel approach to bias correction in AI models, combining multi-scale projections with KL divergence-based adjustments for dynamic bias mitigation. Features like exponential moving averages for tracking statistics and adaptive correction thresholds may offer unique advantages for improving model fairness. Experts are encouraged to evaluate its effectiveness and potential impact in real-world applications. 

## Context
- The code was generated and optimized by Grok, ChatGPT, and Claude.

## Disclaimer
This module includes code that was partially generated with the assistance of large language models (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok), then manually refined and validated. 

It is provided for educational, research, and general-purpose development use only. The author does not take responsibility for any downstream use that may violate the terms of service of the AI tools involved.

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of this module complies with applicable terms, especially when integrating it into systems that compete with or replicate the functionality of proprietary AI models.

## Usage
```python
import torch
from bias_correction_layer import AdaptiveBiasReflectiveLayerV7

layer = AdaptiveBiasReflectiveLayerV7(hidden_dim=768) un
x = torch.randn(16, 24, 768)
output = layer(x)
